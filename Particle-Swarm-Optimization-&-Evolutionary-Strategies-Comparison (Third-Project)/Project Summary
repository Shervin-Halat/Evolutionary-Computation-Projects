In this project we were to evaluate and compare costs of two algorithms of 'Particle Swarm Optimization' 
(PSO) and 'Evolutionary Strategies' (ES(1+1)) versus both number of iterations and evaluations.
It should be noted that multiple ES(1+1) method with different 'Optimal Ps' values were considered 
for the comparison with PSO method.
